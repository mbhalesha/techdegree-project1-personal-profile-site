https://mbhalesha.github.io/techdegree-project1-personal-profile-site
 
I customized a personal online profile by adding graphics, adding text, and improving the look of a web page using Cascading Style Sheets, the formatting language of the web. 

This online profile contains
- Webpages: home, experience, projects, and blog
- Homepage consists of my background, my goals, my hobbies
- The Experience page consists of my work experience in the recent past
- The Projects page consists of two projects that I created to practice my HTML and CSS skills - he links to the projects are included.
- THe Blog page consists of two blog post titles and links to continue reading at my WordPress site: https://manishabhalesha.wordpress.com
- I included icons at the bottom of different social media websites/my work online: CodePen, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and WordPress

- I learned how to transform the profile image on hover so it would scale and rotate to give a bit of fun interaction with the page. It's important for the scale and rotation to add to the page in a positive and engaging manner.
- I learned consistency among the webpages are important to create a theme for the website. This includes the design, the header, colors, and fonts.
- I learned how to include images, give class names, and style the images so they are rounded at the corners and have a border.
