I customized a personal online profile by adding graphics, adding text, and improving the look of a web page using Cascading Style Sheets, the formatting language of the web. 

This online profile contains

- homepage consists of my background, my goals, my hobbies
- the Experience page consists of my work experience in the recent past
- the Projects page consists of two projects that I created to practice my HTML and CSS skills. The links to the projects are included.
- the Blog page consists of two blog post titles and links to continue reading at my WordPress site: https://manishabhalesha.wordpress.com
